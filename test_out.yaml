# Default BETSE simulation configuration file.
#
# The following settings can be changed to customize simulations in BETSE. When
# editing the file, note that it is essential that the line indentations (tabs)
# are maintained in their current order, and that only variable assignments are
# changed. Variable names must not be changed. Comments are prefixed by "#" and
# may be altered.
#
# Note that each BETSE simulation requires an initialization run. The
# initialization is required to ensure that a simulation begins with a system in
# a steady state. Each subsequent simulation depends on an initialization run
# specific to the cell geometry and initialized parameters.
#
# Note: parameters listed under the "INTERNAL USE ONLY" section should be
# modified only with care.
#
# Pathnames
# ----------
# For portability, files and directories are configured below as relative rather
# than absolute pathnames (e.g., as "sim_init.betse" rather than
# "/Users/iamawesome/my_sim/sim_init.betse"). Such pathnames are relative to the
# directory containing this file. This allows the directory to be safely moved
# without breaking existing tissue simulations.
#
# A Note on YAML
# ----------
# This file is formatted according to the YAML ([Y]AML [A]in't [M]arkup
# [L]anguage) standard. YAML is a human-readable data serialization format
# useful for configuration files -- like this one. For details, please see
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML.

# Cluster chape and individual tissues can be defined by bitmaps, or specified manually by cell number.

# are changed in the config file after running an init, the init must be run over again with the new settings.
